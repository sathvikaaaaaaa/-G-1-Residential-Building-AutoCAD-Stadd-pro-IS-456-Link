Successfully delivered a multi-phase engineering project that bridged the gap between structural simulation and professional structural drawing production. By leveraging STAAD.Pro for analytical modeling and AutoCAD for precise drafting, I streamlined the workflow from initial design to final production drawings under strict project deadlines.

I performed comprehensive design calculations for critical elements—including staircases, one-way/two-way slabs, and beams—strictly adhering to IS 456:2000 and relevant Indian Standard codes. This project demonstrates a high level of technical rigor in managing complex geometric data and maintaining the drafting accuracy essential for high-level BIM-centric roles.
